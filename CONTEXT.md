# dev-skills

A curated, flat set of adapted development-workflow skills installed directly
from `toxicgozen/dev-skills`. Every directory under `skills/` is part of the
shipped set; upstream organization and lifecycle states are not part of the
consumer interface.

## Language

**Issue tracker**:
The tool that hosts a repo's issues — GitHub Issues, Linear, a local `.scratch/`
markdown convention, or similar. Skills like `to-tickets`, `to-spec`, and
`triage` read from and write to it.
_Avoid_: backlog manager, backlog backend, issue host

**Issue**:
A single tracked unit of work inside an **Issue tracker** — a bug, task, spec,
or slice produced by `to-tickets`.
_Avoid_: ticket (use only when quoting external systems that call them tickets,
or for a **Decision ticket** — see below)

**Decision ticket**:
A `wayfinder` unit — a child **Issue** of a `wayfinder:map` holding a question
whose resolution is a decision, not a slice of a build to execute. The
**decision** qualifier keeps it distinct from an implementation ticket;
`wayfinder` introduces the term, then uses "ticket".

**Triage role**:
A canonical state-machine label applied to an **Issue** during triage (for
example, `needs-triage` or `ready-for-agent`). Each role maps to a real label
string in the **Issue tracker** through repository-local configuration.

## Relationships

- An **Issue tracker** holds many **Issues**.
- An **Issue** carries one **Triage role** at a time.
- A **Decision ticket** is an **Issue** and a child of a `wayfinder:map`.
